# Erebus
Erebus is a simulation competition environtment for a new sub-league for [RoboCupJunior(RCJ) Rescue](https://rescue.rcj.cloud/), running as a demonstration in 2021. The challenge is designed for semi-experienced to highly experienced programmers. The aim of the competition is to program a customizable robot to autonomously navigate and map a complex maze environemnt whilst detecting victims and avoiding obstacles. 

Later releases of this platform will be used for the RCJ Rescue 2021 International Event as a demonstration competition based on [these rules](https://cdn.robocup.org/junior/wp/2021/03/2021_RescueNewSimulationDemo_Rules_draft01.pdf).
